On July the 3rd, a bunch of freshly “techified” entrepreneurs/aspiring-developers showcased, in front of a large audience, the result of their [9-week intensive & immersive training in web application development](http://www.lewagon.org/program).

<img src='blog_image_path Brussels/demoday/_batch2.png' alt="Le Wagon Brussels, 2nd batch of Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp students">

The startup projects issued from this 2nd edition of [Le Wagon Brussels](http://www.lewagon.org/brussels)’ bootcamp were very diverse and each MVP (« minimum viable product ») already pretty sleek. Quite a feat, when you think that the participants could not read nor write a single line of code just 9 weeks before and that they only had 10 days at the end of the bootcamp to work on their application prototypes! Here's an overview of what they built from scratch...

Disclaimer: in addition to the 9 startup/project apps showcased in this video, 2 additional ones were built during the last 10 days of the bootcamp:
</br>- one that was developed for an organisation's internal needs, hence not displayed;
</br>- one that has been acquired by a private firm just after the bootcamp, hence not displayable anymore ;-)

It analyzes the DNA data and provides its users with reports on their potential future diseases and drug responses. This is done in three very simple steps: the user orders their DNA kit, sends back a saliva sample to Exon and, a couple of weeks later, a genetic report is available online.

### [Branch-ed](http://branch-ed.herokuapp.com/) - Learn something online and stay motivated

![Branch-ed, learn something online and stay motivated](blog_image_path Brussels/demoday/Branch-ed.jpg)

Project developed by : [Anthony Limère](https://github.com/Antholimere), [Martijn Kerckhaert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martijnkerckhaert) & [Nicolas Rasmussen](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/nicolas-rasmussen/65/85b/988).

About 80% of people who start learning something online quit before they are halfway through. The Branch-ed team pinpointed two main reasons why people don’t complete online classes: there  is way too much (bad or outdated) content on the web and most importantly no overview on this content. [Branch-ed](http://branch-ed.herokuapp.com/) offers structure for people to track their progress and stay motivated throughout their learning journey. You can use Branch-ed to learn, but also to create « branches », hence course paths, for the community.
