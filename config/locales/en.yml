      cv: Your developer portfolio
      cv_details_html: |
        In only 2 months, build several web applications, including
        a <strong>clone of Airbnb</strong> and <strong>your own personal project</strong>. Deploy these apps
        and build yourself a solid Github portfolio.
      ruby: |
        Get familiar with the command line and Git.
        Learn the basics of programming with Ruby and code
        programs playing with variables, methods,
        loops and conditional statements. Discover how you can
        read and write in files and how you can collect
        interesting data by scraping a website or by calling
        an API (for instance Twitter API).
      software: |
        Discover OOP (Object-Oriented programming) and learn to
        build advanced softwares by structuring your programs
        into different objects. If you want to build a social
        network, a market-place, a car-rental system, a restaurant
        booking platform... then you need to organize your code
        with a smart architecture. Same as an architect who
        wants to build a house, he must respect patterns and procedures.
        During this week, you will code your first applications
        following the MVC design pattern.
      database: |
        Programs need to store information in a database.
        Without databases, Facebook would lose your information
        every time you log in! Learn to design a database by defining
        tables and connections. Then discover SQL,
        the language used to read/write data and make queries to
        the database. 
      frontend: |
        Improve you UI culture and learn all about HTML,
        CSS & best practices in web-design (positioning techniques, animations).
        Get familiar with Bootstrap, a useful library to
        prototype web-applications. Then move on to Javascript
        and jQuery. Learn to manipulate the DOM,
        define events, and make AJAX requests with Javascript.
        You will play with lots of cool APIs during this
        module (Trello, Slack, Facebook , etc...).
      rails: |
        Time to put all your skills together and dive into Rails.
        No big deal here, you already know most of its
        elementary blocks and you will feel right at home!
        During your Rails training, you will have to code Airbnb
        from scratch in 5 days. You will work in teams to
        learn to collaborate on Github using pull requests and deploy
        your apps on Heroku, using the same workflow as successful
        startups.
