      cv: Your developer portfolio
      cv_details_html: |
        In 2 months only, build several web applications, including
        a Airbnb clone and your own personal project. Deploy these apps
        and build yourself a solid Github portfolio.
      ruby: |
        Get familiar with the command line and Git.
        Learn the basics of programming with ruby and code
        little programs playing with variables, methods,
        loops and conditional statements. Discover how you can
        read and write in files and how you can collect
        interesting data by scraping a website or by calling
        an API (for instance Twitter API).
      software: |
        Discover OOP (Object-Oriented programming) and learn to
        build advanced softwares by structuring your programs
        into different objects. If you want to build a social
        network, a market-place, a car-rental system, a restaurant
        booking platform... then you need to organize your code
        with a smart architecture. Same as an architect who
        wants to build a house, he must respect some patterns.
        During this week, you will code your first applications
        following the MVC design pattern.
      database: |
        Programs need to store information in a database.
        Without database, Facebook would loose your information
        every time you log in! Learn to design a database by defining
        its tables and their connections. Then discover SQL,
        the language used to make queries to the database
        and read/write data.
      frontend: |
        Improve you UI culture and learn all about HTML,
        CSS & best practices in web-design (positioning techniques, animations).
        Get familiar with Bootstrap, a usefull library to
        prototype web-applications. Then move on to javascript
        and jQuery. Learn to manipulate the DOM,
        define events, and make AJAX requests with Javascript.
        You will play with lots of cool APIs during this
        module (Trello API, Slack API, Facebook API, etc...).
      rails: |
        Time to put all your skills together and dive into Rails.
        No big deal here, you already know most of its
        elementary blocks and you will feel like at home!
        During your Rails training, you will have to code Airbnb
        from scratch in 5 days. You will work in teams and you will
        learn to collaborate on Github using pull requests and deploy
        your apps on Heroku, using the same workflow as in the best
        startups.
